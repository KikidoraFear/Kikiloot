## What it do?!
if you are the LOOT MASTER and open some loot, it will
- add all the items equal to or above the selected threshold to the shared item list which is shown in an additional window
- give everything below to yourself (except for gold...doesnt work, big poop)
- post in /ra "Roll for yada yada" with SR and spreadsheet information (see below) when item icon is clicked
- show rolls next to loot window (only shows people who have SR if SR exists, also ignores /roll 100 100 and other shenanigans)
- clicking a player button will give the item to the player (if the loot window is open!)

if you are not the LOOT MASTER:
- add all the items equal to or above the selected threshold to the shared item list which is shown in an additional window
- clicking an item will request a roll in /ra "Roll request..."

SR-Button:  
SR can be imported by exporting raidres data as csv:

clicking SR button and paste csv

SS-Button:  
Spreadsheet info can be imported if captain is nice enough to format
the spreadsheet similarly to raidres  
captain's excel skills are poop though

CL-Button:  
clears the current item list

## What it not do?!
- get rid of the rash on your inner thigh

## ToDo:
- whisper people who have SR (maybe)
