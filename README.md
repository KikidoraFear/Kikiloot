## What it do?!
if you are the LOOT MASTER, open loot and it will
- add all the greens and higher to the item list which is shown in an additional window
- give greys and whites to yourself
- post in /ra "Roll for yada yada" with SR and spreadsheet information (see below), by pressing an item icon
- show top 3 rolls next to loot icons (only shows people who have SR if SR exists, also ignores /roll 100 100 and other shenanigans)

if you are not the LOOT MASTER:
- shows loot master's opened loot
- will display SR and spreadsheet info in tooltip

SR can be imported by exporting raidres data as csv:

clicking SR button and paste csv

Spreadsheet info can be imported if captain is nice enough to format
the spreadsheet similarly to raidres  
work in progress! captain's excel skills are poop

## What it not do?!
- distribute loot

## ToDo:
- whisper people who have SR
- show item info in tooltip, idk how though (maybe whisper item link to yourself or something, idk)
