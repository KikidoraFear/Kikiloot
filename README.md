## What it do?!
if you are the LOOT MASTER and open some loot, it will
- add all the greens and higher to the item list which is shown in an additional window
- give greys and whites to yourself
- post in /ra "Roll for yada yada" with SR and spreadsheet information (see below) when item icon is clicked
- show top 3 rolls next to loot icons (only shows people who have SR if SR exists, also ignores /roll 100 100 and other shenanigans)

if you are not the LOOT MASTER:
- shows loot master's opened loot
- will display SR and spreadsheet info in tooltip if added

SR-Button:  
SR can be imported by exporting raidres data as csv:

clicking SR button and paste csv

SS-Button:  
Spreadsheet info can be imported if captain is nice enough to format
the spreadsheet similarly to raidres  
captain's excel skills are poop though

CL-Button:  
if you are the loot master, it will clear the current item list (for everyone)

## What it not do?!
- distribute loot

## ToDo:
- whisper people who have SR (should be fairly easy to add)
